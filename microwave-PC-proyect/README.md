# Microwave PC Modding Project

This project explores the transformation of a microwave oven into a fully functional PC. The main objective is to combine creative hardware modification (*case modding*) with practical system building, turning an everyday household object into a unique and working computer.

## 🔧 Project Summary

- The microwave structure is fully disassembled and repurposed to house the essential PC components.
- Modifications include openings for airflow, positioning of the motherboard, GPU, and I/O ports.
- A significant focus is placed on planning, safety (removal of sharp edges), and adaptation of the internal layout.

## 🧠 Challenges and Progress

Throughout the project, unexpected technical issues—such as BIOS access failures and compatibility concerns—have arisen. However, these challenges have been gradually resolved, demonstrating strong troubleshooting and problem-solving skills.

Despite the difficulties, the project has shown steady progress, particularly in structure modification, hardware integration, and overall planning.
